# <img src="bootdev-removebg-preview.png" alt="Asteroid Game Logo" width="40" style="margin-right: 5px;" /> Asteroids Game

A small Python game inspired by the classic *Asteroids*. Built using Pygame, and extended from 
*Build Asteroids using Python and Pygame*, a guided project from the learning platform **Boot.dev**

## ðŸ§± Original Guided Project Scope

The original project provided the foundational Asteroids game structure, including:

- Core game architecture with setup, game loop, and player movement

- Use of Pygame sprites and groups to manage game objects

- Asteroid spawning and splitting (large â†’ medium â†’ small)

- Basic shooting mechanics and asteroid destruction

- Collision detection (bulletâ€“asteroid, playerâ€“asteroid)

## âœ¨ Extensions Beyond the Guided Project

Iâ€™ve expanded the original foundation with the following enhancements:

- Added a scoring system that rewards player accuracy 
 
- Implemented multiple lives and respawning mechanics  
- Added explosion effects when asteroids are destroyed  
- Introduced acceleration and deceleration to player movement  
- Asteroids now wrap around the screen instead of disappearing    
  *Not for the player â€” to simulate the feeling of being lost in tutorial hell*  
- Added a galaxy background for visual depth  
- Designed asteroids with 3 lumpy shapes instead of perfect circles  
- Introduced a shield power-up that destroys asteroids on contact  
- Added a laser power-up that removes the shooting cooldown
